create app with the following interface:
a) ListView
b) RefreshIndicator
c) SnackBar
Tasks:
a) ListView source is a list of strings with initial value ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
b) Implement pull-to-refresh feature:
Replace list entirely with ["Cyan", "Magenta", "Yellow"]
Only allow refresh once - further pulls do nothing
d) Display a SnackBar with message
On first refresh: "New colors loaded"
On further refreshes: "No more updates"
