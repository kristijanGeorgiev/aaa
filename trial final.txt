Instructions: Create a simple Hotel Room Management Application. Before you start, read the instructions to the end.
Tasks:
•
Create a Web Api solution using .Net 8.
•
All data in your solution should be persisted in a database. Use Entity Framework Core Code first approach.
•
Create a layered architecture following the Service-Repository pattern and implement the requirements in the 3 layers appropriately: Data, Service and WebApi layers (feel free to use other naming convention for your layers as preferable).
•
Create the necessary entities: Guest and Room.
•
Guest should have the following properties: Autogenerated PK Id, First Name, Last Name, DOB, Address, Nationality, Check-in Date, Check-out Date an FK Room Id which will be the connection to the Rooms table.
•
On the Guest entity set the following restrictions: Guest Id should be autogenerated, all other properties (First Name, Last Name, DOB, Address, Nationality, Check-in Date, Check-out Date) should be required, First Name should have max length of 200 chars and Last Name should have max length of 400 chars, Address should have max length of 600 chars.
•
Room should have the following properties: Autogenerated PK Id, Number, Floor, Type.
•
On the Room entity set the following restrictions: Room Id should be autogenerated, all other properties (Number, Floor, Type) should be required.
•
Each Guest is allowed to book (stay) one Room at the same time only, while multiple Guests can be staying the same Room (one Room can relate to multiple Guests).
•
Create the two appropriate interfaces and define methods for get all, get by Id, create, update and delete for Guest and Room.
•
Create DTOs for the Guest and Room.
•
Create two services and implement the interfaces for Guest and Room, so that they can be called as services.
•
Create two API controllers for Guest and Room CRUD methods using the services and add appropriate implementation using DI and IOC.
•
Implement the GuestRepository and RoomRepository.
•
Implement the two interfaces IGuestRepository and IRoomRespository respectively in the correct layer. Give Clean Architecture and Generate Code
