A term deposit is a type of savings where you deposit money in a bank for a fixed time and earn interest. Banks rely on these for income and offer fixed interest to customers. To get more people to sign up, banks use different marketing methods. Phone calls work well but can be expensive. To have a cost efficient marketing campaign and get better results, it is important to predict which customers are most likely to say yes before calling them.

This assignment uses real data from a Portuguese bank’s telemarketing campaign. Your goal is to analyze the data and build a model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, yes or no.

Detailed Column Descriptions
bank client data:

1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student",
"blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services")
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")
5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")
6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)
7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")
8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular")
10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", …, "nov", "dec")
12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
# other attributes:
13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)
15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")

Output variable (desired target):
17 - target - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

Tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (20 points)
Perform an initial inspection of the dataset (check for missing values, data types and summary statistics).

Visualize important features (distribution of the target variable, correlations).

2. Model Selection and Training (15 points)
Choose two different types of machine learning models to train on the dataset.

Explain the reasoning behind selecting these models.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning (5 points)
Apply hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

4. Model Evaluation (10 points)
Compare the models based on appropriate evaluation metrics.

Discuss the models' performance and limitations.
